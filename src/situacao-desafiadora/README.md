# 🧩 Salary Calculation (Old Exercise)

This code was written at the very beginning of my **Systems Development – SENAI** course.  
Because I was still learning, everything ended up inside the `main` method, without good structure or separation of logic.

I keep this file here only as a record of my progress — today I no longer code this way and already use cleaner, organized and modular practices.
